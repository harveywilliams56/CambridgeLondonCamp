One-day crash course on machine learning for teenagers. Inteded to give a general overview and some fun demonstrations.

These are primarily slides which I will talk the students through rather than entirely independent notebooks. Perhaps I will add more prose to an updated version.

Much of the images and examples are taken largely wholesale from the Fast.AI course and this is intended to be a bit-size version of the first couple of chapters.
